Initial implementation of Whisper Flow

Completed:
- Created GitHub repo: https://github.com/jamesdowzard/whisper-flow
- Implemented core architecture:
  - Audio recording (sounddevice)
  - Whisper transcription (faster-whisper)
  - AI text editing (Ollama/OpenAI/Anthropic)
  - Text typing at cursor (pynput)
  - Global hotkey handler (pynput)
  - macOS menu bar app (rumps)
  - Configuration management (pydantic)
- Added CLI test commands: --test, --benchmark, --record-test
- Benchmarked performance: ~1s transcription, ~3-4s Ollama editing

Commits:
- 0becb06: Initial implementation
- 240e6fc: Add CLI test and benchmark commands

Issues discovered:
- Microphone permission: Python needs mic access in System Settings > Privacy
- Default audio device may be virtual (Carlo Verbosi) instead of MacBook mic
- Need to use SwitchAudioSource to set correct input device

In progress:
- Floating overlay button (overlay.py) - code written, not tested
- Audio device selection in config

Next steps:
1. Test and debug the floating overlay UI
2. Add proper microphone permission handling
3. Test full end-to-end recording flow
4. Commit uncommitted changes (overlay.py, device selection)

Blockers:
- Microphone not capturing audio in tests (permission or device issue)

v0.1.0 Release

Completed:
- Fixed PyInstaller build with proper module exclusions
- Fixed code signing (PyInstaller native signing, not codesign --deep)
- Apple notarization passed (after service cleared up)
- Created GitHub release: https://github.com/jamesdowzard/rodin/releases/tag/v0.1.0
- Artifacts: DMG (67MB) and ZIP (227MB) for ARM64

Build notes:
- Notarization was timing out (30+ min) due to Apple service issues
- Re-ran workflow after service cleared, completed in ~1 min
- Release includes signed, notarized, stapled app

Next session:
- Test floating overlay button (#11)
- Test microphone permission handling (#13)

Overlay Testing

Completed:
- Tested floating overlay button - appears on right side of screen
- Fixed button click not responding (added acceptsFirstMouse_ method)
- Recording animation works - button turns red during recording
- Hotkey (Cmd+Shift+Space) works for recording
- Full pipeline tested: record → save → transcribe → "no speech detected"

Issues found and fixed:
- Button clicks weren't registering on borderless NSWindow
- Fix: Added acceptsFirstMouse_ to MicButtonView
- Fix: Added setAcceptsMouseMovedEvents_ to window

Remaining:
- Accessibility permission prompt (pynput hotkey monitoring needs manual grant)
- Microphone permission handling (#13)
- Actual transcription test with real speech
